# Zaletros 

## Description
### What is Zaletros? 

Zaletros (pronounced Zaal-leh-trohs) is a turn based RPG game, built in a 2D environment. The player controls a party of four characters, where each has three different subclasses with unique skills to enchance the game play. In the world of Zaletros, the player will battle random monsters and main bosses to unlock new gear sets and skills which will help them progress futher through the story.  

### Why?
Zaletros keeps the old school feeling of the RPG games, but brings back a new flavour where the player can customize the characters to fit their play style. With three different subclasses per character, the player will be able to create their own battle strategy for each monster they'll encounter. The addition of gear sets helps the player to level up their character's statistics in order to fighter harder monsters. 

### How? 

The sprites for Zaletros were developed in Aseprite while world areas and control menus were created in Photoshop CC. Zaletros was built in Godot Engine, and follows the concept of a tree of nested scenes. Each scene provide a visual for the player while the activities in the game are controlled by the scripts written in GDScript. GDScript is Godot's own scripting language, similar to Python. The game mechanics for bosses, character skills and gear sets were written out in detail in Excel to prepare them for developement.
