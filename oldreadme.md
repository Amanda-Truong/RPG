# Zaletros

## Project Description
### What?
  Zaletros is an RPG turn based game. It will be a 2D open world game that is about a party of four, each with a different class, hunting down monsters that the guild assigns them. It will be a solo game with the user controlling the party of four. 
### Why?
  Zaltetros will be focused on the user picking branches in skill trees for each party member to build the party the way they want to. It will also be focused on re-killing bosses for better gear rather than most turn based games being focused on buying gear and skills without the flexibility of changing how a class plays. 
### How?
  Zaltetros will be a PC game made using Godot with sprites being made with Aseprite and Photoshop. Values for skills, gear, and boss stats will be stored as well as fight mechanics. 

Front End/UI: 
* GDScript

Back End:
* GDScript

Tools:
* Godot
* Adobe Photoshop
* Aseprite
* Git/Github

Reference Works:
* Final Fantasy 1: the open world and sprite look
* Borderlands games: the skill trees and re-killing of bosses feature. 
  
Key Contribution:
* Letting a user have flexibility on a class’s role in the party with skill trees
* Letting the user kill most bosses whenever they want (even outside of the story)
* Allowing a user to kill a boss more than one time for gear

## Deliverables
* Documentation on game design
* User can roam the map and enter special areas
* User can spend experience on skills
* User can enter boss fights
* User can encounter random battles
* User can equip gear
* User can follow story to unlock content
* Game Application
* Documentation and Testing
